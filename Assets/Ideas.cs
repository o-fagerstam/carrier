/*
 * Game based around carriers, sort of like Crimson Skies but based on a boat
 *
 * Carrier can launch:
 * * Smaller boats (Destroyers?)
 * * Airplanes
 *
 * Technological developments:
 * * Faster/better design of torpedo boats
 * * * American "Sea sled" reached 69 km/h with a 1914 design
 * * * Fast WW2 boats like the PT torpedo boat could potentially have been developed much faster
 * * Seaplane tenders
 * * * Were in use by WW1
 * * * Cruiser-size tenders could carry around 9 planes (cf. HMAS Albatros (1928))
 * * * Cheaper than carriers, but less useful in bad weather or when taken by surprise
 * * * Catapult-launching vs starting from water
 *
 * Other vehicles (AI only?):
 * * Battleships
 * * Land installations
 * * Zeppelins (bombers? airplane carriers? mission targets?)
 *
 * Some sort of between-mission thing:
 * * Open world like mount & blade or Sid Meier's Pirates?
 *
 *
 * Boat features:
 * * Hitscan on internals
 * * Taking on water
